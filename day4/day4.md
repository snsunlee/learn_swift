- Arrays let us store lots of values in one place, then read them out using integer indices. Arrays must always be specialized so they contain one specific type, and they have helpful functionality such as `count`, `append()`, and `contains()`.
- Dictionaries also let us store lots of values in one place, but let us read them out using keys we specify. They must be specialized to have one specific type for key and another for the value, and have similar functionality to arrays, such as `contains()` and `count`.
- Sets are a third way of storing lots of values in one place, but we don’t get to choose the order in which they store those items. Sets are really efficient at finding whether they contain a specific item.
- Enums let us create our own simple types in Swift so that we can specify a range of acceptable values such as a list of actions the user can perform, the types of files we are able to write, or the types of notification to send to the user.
- Swift must always know the type of data inside a constant or variable, and mostly uses type inference to figure that out based on the data we assign. However, it’s also possible to use type annotation to force a particular type.
